    "All the Mods started out as a private pack for just a few friends of mine that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other \"big name\" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well.",
    "In All the Mods 9 we will continue the tradition adding many new mods while going for more stability.",
    "Does \"All the Mods\" really contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not."
